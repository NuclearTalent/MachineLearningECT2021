From your results calculate the variance of these paramaters (recall that this is equal to the diagonal elements of the matrix $(\\hat{X}^T\\hat{X})+\\lambda\\hat{I})^{-1}$).

    "ensures that for each feature/predictor we study the mean value is\n",
    "zero and the variance is one (every column in the design/feature\n",
    "matrix).  This scaling has the drawback that it does not ensure that\n",
    "we have a particular maximum or minimum in our data set. Another\n",
    "function included in **Scikit-Learn** is the **MinMaxScaler** which\n",
    "ensures that all features are exactly between $0$ and $1$. The\n",

    "The **Normalizer** scales each data\n",

    "radius of 1. This means every data point is scaled by a different number (by the\n",
    "inverse of itâ€™s length).\n",
    "This normalization is often used when only the direction (or angle) of the data matters,\n",
    "not the length of the feature vector.\n",

    "The **RobustScaler** works similarly to the StandardScaler in that it\n",
    "ensures statistical properties for each feature that guarantee that\n",
    "they are on the same scale. However, the RobustScaler uses the median\n",
    "and quartiles, instead of mean and variance. This makes the\n",
