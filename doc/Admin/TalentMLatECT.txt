2020 Nuclear TALENT Course on Machine Learning in Nuclear Experiment and Theory

Applications are open for the 2020 TALENT course on Machine
Learning in Nuclear Experiment and Theory.  The Nuclear TALENT
(Training in Advanced Low Energy Nuclear Theory) initiative, see also
http://www.nucleartalent.org, a multi-national network of several
Asian, European and North American institutions, aims to develop a broad
curriculum that will serve as a platform for cutting-edge theory of
nuclei and their reactions.


The Nuclear TALENT initiative organizes a course on 
"Machine Learning in Nuclear Experiment and Theory" to be held at
at The European Center for Theoretical Nuclear Physics and Related Areas
(ECT*), Trento, Italy from June 22 to July 10 2020.

The lecturers are: 
Daniel Bazin (Michigan State University), 
Morten Hjorth-Jensen (Michigan State University and University of Oslo),
Michelle Kuchera (Davidson College),
Sean Liddick Daniel Bazin (Michigan State University), 
Raghuram Ramanujan (Davidson College).

The deadline for applications is April 13, 2020.  For more information
on how to apply see http://www.ectstar.eu/talent (application link
available from December 2019), See also
https://github.com/NuclearTalent/MachineLearningECT for more details
about the course, with learning outcomes and more. For a display of
learning material see
https://nucleartalent.github.io/MachineLearningECT/doc/web/course.html


The target groups are Master of Science and PhD students and
early post-doctoral researchers, both experimentalists and
theorists. More experienced researchers may apply, but will be
considered only on a fully-self-supported basis if numbers and space
permit. Local support is available for at most 15-20 participants.

For additional information on each of the courses, please see
http://www.nucleartalent.org. Prior to the TALENT course, the ECT*
organizes a Doctoral Training program on Quantum Computing and Quantum
Information theories. The Doctoral training program starts right after
the Talent course, July 13 and ends on August 7, see
http://www.ectstar.eu/node/799 for more information. The doctoral
training program can be combined with the TALENT course.
