===== Why a course on Machine Learning for Nuclear Physics? =====


Probability theory and
statistical methods play a central role in science. Nowadays we are
surrounded by huge amounts of data. For example, there are about one
trillion web pages; more than one hour of video is uploaded to YouTube
every second, amounting to 10 years of content every day; the genomes
of 1000s of people, each of which has a length of more than a billion
base pairs, have been sequenced by various labs and so on. This deluge
of data calls for automated methods of data analysis, which is exactly
what machine learning provides. The purpose of this Nuclear Talent
course is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of
machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to
physicists and nuclear physicists in particular. We will start with
some of the basic methods from supervised learning and statistical
data analysis, such as various regression methods before we move into
deep learning methods for both supervised and unsupervised learning,
with an emphasis on the analysis of nuclear physics experiments and
theoretical nuclear physics. The students will work on hands-on daily
examples as well as projects than can result in final
credits. Exercises and projects will be provided and the aim is to
give the participants an overview on how machine learning can be used
to analyze and study nuclear physics problems (experiment and theory).
The major scope is to give the participants a deeper understanding on
what Machine learning and Data Analysis are and how they can be used
to analyze data from nuclear physics experiments and perform
theoretical calculations of nuclear many-body systems.



The goals of the Nuclear Talent course on Machine Learning and Data
Analysis are to give the participants a deeper understanding and
critical view of several widely popular Machine Learning algorithms,
covering both supervised and unsupervised learning. The learning
outcomes involve an understanding of the following central methods:

* Basic concepts of machine learning and data analysis and statistical concepts like expectation values, variance, covariance, correlation functions and errors;
* Estimation of errors using cross-validation, blocking, bootstrapping and jackknife methods;
* Optimization of functions
* Linear Regression and Logistic Regression;
* Dimensionality reductions, from PCA to clustering
* Boltzmann machines;
* Neural networks;
* Decisions trees and Random Forests
* Support Vector Machines
* Convolutional Neural Networks and deep learning
* Recurrent Neural Networks and Autoenconders

and their applications to nuclear physics problems. We are targeting
an audience of graduate students (both Master of Science and PhD) as
well as post-doctoral researchers in nuclear experiment and theory.

The teaching teams consists of both theorists and experimentalists. We
believe such a mix is important as it gives the students a better
understanding on how data are obtained, and what are the limitations
and possibilities in understanding and interpreting the experimental
information.
