===== Why a course on Machine Learning for Nuclear Physics? =====


Probability theory and
statistical methods play a central role in science. Nowadays we are
surrounded by huge amounts of data. For example, there are about one
trillion web pages; more than one hour of video is uploaded to YouTube
every second, amounting to 10 years of content every day; the genomes
of 1000s of people, each of which has a length of more than a billion
base pairs, have been sequenced by various labs and so on. This deluge
of data calls for automated methods of data analysis, which is exactly
what machine learning provides. The purpose of this Nuclear Talent
course is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of
machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to
physicists and nuclear physicists in particular. We will start with
some of the basic methods from supervised learning and statistical
data analysis, such as various regression methods before we move into
deep learning methods for both supervised and unsupervised learning,
with an emphasis on the analysis of nuclear physics experiments and
theoretical nuclear physics. The students will work on hands-on daily
examples as well as projects than can result in final
credits. Exercises and projects will be provided and the aim is to
give the participants an overview on how machine learning can be used
to analyze and study nuclear physics problems (experiment and theory).
The major scope is to give the participants a deeper understanding on
what Machine learning and Data Analysis are and how they can be used
to analyze data from nuclear physics experiments and perform
theoretical calculations of nuclear many-body systems.



The goals of the Nuclear Talent course on Machine Learning and Data
Analysis are to give the participants a deeper understanding and
critical view of several widely popular Machine Learning algorithms,
covering both supervised and unsupervised learning. The learning
outcomes involve an understanding of the following central methods:

* Basic concepts of machine learning and data analysis and statistical concepts like expectation values, variance, covariance, correlation functions and errors;
* Estimation of errors using cross-validation, blocking, bootstrapping and jackknife methods;
* Optimization of functions
* Linear Regression and Logistic Regression;
* Dimensionality reductions, from PCA to clustering
* Boltzmann machines;
* Neural networks;
* Decisions trees and Random Forests
* Support Vector Machines
* Convolutional Neural Networks and deep learning
* Recurrent Neural Networks and Autoenconders

and their applications to nuclear physics problems. We are targeting
an audience of graduate students (both Master of Science and PhD) as
well as post-doctoral researchers in nuclear experiment and theory.

The teaching teams consists of both theorists and experimentalists. We
believe such a mix is important as it gives the students a better
understanding on how data are obtained, and what are the limitations
and possibilities in understanding and interpreting the experimental
information.

===== Introduction to the Talent Courses =====

A recently established initiative, "Training in Advanced Low Energy Nuclear Theory":"http://www.nucleartalent.org",  
aims at providing an advanced and comprehensive training to graduate students
and young researchers in low-energy nuclear theory. The initiative
is a multinational network between several European and Northern
American institutions and aims at developing a broad curriculum that
will provide the platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding
nuclei and nuclear reactions. These objectives will be met by
offering series of lectures, commissioned from experienced teachers
in nuclear theory. The educational material generated under this
program will be collected in the form of WEB-based courses,
textbooks, and a variety of modern educational resources. No such
all-encompassing material is available at present; its development
will allow dispersed university groups to profit from the best
expertise available.

===== Aims and Learning Outcomes =====



This three-week TALENT course on nuclear theory will focus on Machine
Learning and Data Analysis algorithms for nuclear physics and to use
such methods in the interpretation of data on the structure of nuclear
systems.

We propose approximately forty-five hours of lectures over three weeks and a
comparable amount of practical computer and exercise sessions, including the
setting of individual problems and the organization of various individual projects.

The mornings will consist of lectures and the
afternoons will be devoted to exercises meant to shed light on the exposed theory, 
the computational projects  and individual student projects. These
components will be coordinated to foster student engagement,
maximize learning and create lasting value for the students. For the
benefit of the TALENT series and of the community, material (courses,
slides, problems and solutions, reports on students' projects) will be
made publicly available using version control software like git and posted electronically on 
github":"https://github.com. 

As with previous TALENT courses, we envision
the following features for the afternoon sessions: 
* We will use both individual and group work to carry out tasks that are very specific in technical instructions, but leave freedom for creativity.  
* Groups will be carefully put together to maximize diversity of backgrounds.  
* Results will be presented in a conference-like setting to create accountability.  
* We will organize events where individuals and groups exchange their experiences, difficulties and successes to foster interaction.  
* During the school, on-line and lecture-based training tailored to technical issues will be provided. Students will learn to use and interpret the results of computer-based and hand calculations of nuclear models. The lectures will be aligned with the practical computational projects and exercises and the lecturers will be available to help students and work with them during the exercise sessions.  
* These interactions will raise topics not originally envisioned for the course but which are recognized to be valuable for the students. There will be flexibility to organize mini-lectures and discussion sessions on an ad-hoc basis in such cases.  
* Each group of students will maintain an online logbook of their activities and results.  
* Training modules, codes, lectures, practical exercise instructions, online logbooks, instructions and information created by participants will be merged into a comprehensive website that will be available to the community and the public for self-guided training or for use in various educational settings (for example, a graduate course at a university could assign some of the projects as homework or an extra credit project, etc).

=== Learning Outcomes ===

At the end of the course the students should have a basic understanding of
* Statistical data analysis, theory and tools to handle large data sets.
* A solid understanding of central machine learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, involving linear and logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees and random forests, neural networks and deep learning (convolutional neural networks, recursive neural networks etc)
* Be able to write codes for linear regression, logistic regression and use modern libraries like Tensorflow, Pytorch, Scikit-Learn in order to analyze data from nuclear physics experiments and perform theoretical calculations
* A deeper understanding of the statistical properties of the various methods, from the bias-variance tradeoff to resampling techniques.
