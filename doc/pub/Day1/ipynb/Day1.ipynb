    "## Regression analysis, overarching aims\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression modeling deals with the description of  the sampling distribution of a given random variable $y$ and how it varies as function of another variable or a set of such variables $\\boldsymbol{x} =[x_0, x_1,\\dots, x_{n-1}]^T$. \n",
    "The first variable is called the **dependent**, the **outcome** or the **response** variable while the set of variables $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is called the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\\vert \\boldsymbol{x})$, that is the conditional distribution for $\\boldsymbol{y}$ with a given $\\boldsymbol{x}$. The estimation of  $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\\vert \\boldsymbol{x})$ is made using a data set with \n",
    "* $n$ cases $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* Response (target, dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* $p$ so-called explanatory (independent or predictor) variables $\\boldsymbol{x}_i=[x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \\dots, x_{ip-1}]$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ and explanatory variables running from $0$ to $p-1$. See below for more explicit examples.   These variables are also called features or predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    " The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between $\\boldsymbol{y}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$ in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions, making fits and many other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression analysis, overarching aims II\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an experiment in which $p$ characteristics of $n$ samples are\n",
    "measured. The data from this experiment, for various explanatory variables $p$ are normally represented by a matrix  \n",
    "$\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is called the *design\n",
    "matrix*. Additional information of the samples is available in the\n",
    "form of $\\boldsymbol{y}$ (also as above). The variable $\\boldsymbol{y}$ is\n",
    "generally referred to as the *response variable*. The aim of\n",
    "regression analysis is to explain $\\boldsymbol{y}$ in terms of\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{X}$ through a functional relationship like $y_i =\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{X}_{i,\\ast})$. When no prior knowledge on the form of\n",
    "$f(\\cdot)$ is available, it is common to assume a linear relationship\n",
    "between $\\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\\boldsymbol{y}$. This assumption gives rise to\n",
    "the *linear regression model* where $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [\\beta_0, \\ldots,\n",
    "\\beta_{p-1}]^{T}$ are the *regression parameters*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression gives us a set of analytical equations for the parameters $\\beta_j$.\n",

    "## Examples\n",

We could think of these data as a result of an experiment or a complicated numerical experiment. These data are functions of a series of variables $\\boldsymbol{x}=[x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}]$, that is $y_i = y(x_i)$ with $i=0,1,2,\\dots,n-1$. The variables $x_i$ could represent physical quantities like time, temperature, position etc. We assume that $y(x)$ is a smooth function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since obtaining these data points may not be trivial, we want to use these data to fit a function which can allow us to make predictions for values of $y$ which are not in the present set. The perhaps simplest approach is to assume we can parametrize our function in terms of a polynomial of degree $n-1$ with $n$ points, that is"

    "obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in\n",

    "the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain\n",
    "information that would not be available from fitting the model only\n",
    "once using the original training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two resampling methods are often used in Machine Learning analyses,\n",
    "1. The **bootstrap method**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. and **Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",

    "The jackknife is a special case of the independent bootstrap. Still, the jackknife was made\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling methods: Bootstrap\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a nonparametric approach to statistical inference\n",
    "that substitutes computation for more traditional distributional\n",
    "assumptions and asymptotic results. Bootstrapping offers a number of\n",
    "advantages: \n",
    "1. The bootstrap is quite general, although there are some cases in which it fails.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because it does not require distributional assumptions (such as normally distributed errors), the bootstrap can provide more accurate inferences when the data are not well behaved or when the sample size is small.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is possible to apply the bootstrap to statistics with sampling distributions that are difficult to derive, even asymptotically. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is relatively simple to apply the bootstrap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling methods: Bootstrap steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent bootstrap works like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw with replacement $n$ numbers for the observed variables $\\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}^*$ containing the values which were drawn from $\\boldsymbol{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using the vector $\\boldsymbol{x}^*$ compute the estimate (parameter) $\\widehat{\\theta}^*$ by evaluating $\\widehat \\theta$ under the observations $\\boldsymbol{x}^*$. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat this process $k$ times. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done, you can draw a histogram of the relative frequency\n",
    "of the estimator/parameter $\\widehat \\theta^*$. This is your estimate of the probability\n",
    "distribution $p(x)$. Using this probability distribution you can\n",
    "estimate any statistics thereof. In principle you never draw the\n",
    "histogram of the relative frequency of $\\widehat{\\theta}^*$. Instead\n",
    "you use the estimators corresponding to the statistic of interest. For\n",

    "The bias-variance tradeoff summarizes the fundamental tension in\n",
    "machine learning, particularly supervised learning, between the\n",
    "complexity of a model and the amount of training data needed to train\n",
    "it.  Since data is often limited, in practice it is often useful to\n",
    "use a less-complex model with higher bias, that is  a model whose asymptotic\n",
    "performance is worse than another model because it is easier to\n",
    "train and less sensitive to sampling noise arising from having a\n",
    "finite-sized training dataset (smaller variance). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equations tell us that in\n",

    "and low bias. Note that variance is inherently a nonnegative quantity,\n",

    "data are used to fit the statistical learning method, different\n",
    "training data sets  will result in a different estimate. But ideally the\n",
    "estimate for our model should not vary too much between training\n",
    "sets. However, if a method has high variance  then small changes in\n",
